# neutron_scattering_background_signals
This webtool visualizes background signals commonly seen in neutron scattering experiments, including those due to scattering from aluminum, CYTOP and helium gas.
CYTOP is commonly used as a hydrogen-free glue in neutron scattering experiments, and its signals are mainly at Q &#8776; 1 &#8491;<sup>-1</sup> below 10 meV. Helium gas is commonly used to facilitate thermal exchange, and helium atoms scatter neutrons resulting in a temperature-dependent background signal.
